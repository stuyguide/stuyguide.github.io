	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facts:</span></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> THE FIRST MAN</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-- Culture is a people's way of life, it varies based on the person and their religious beliefs. Anthropologists are able to create a picture of early peoples cultural behavior just from excavations.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Hominid describes humans and other creatures that walked upright, also known as australopithecines. Modern scientists are able to deduct that because there are footprints preserved over centuries, and if they only show two footprints, it is logically correct that we can assume that creature walked upright.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Paleolithic Age is when scientists believe that some of the most impressive achievements in human kind occurred. Including the invention of tools and the mastery of fire. Also known as the Old Stone age, the Paleolithic Age is an early part of the Stone Age, hence the other name.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Neolithic Age began at about 8000 b.c and ended around 3000 b.c. Also known as the New Stone Age, the Neolithic Age ended the Stone Age. In this age people learned how to polish tools, make pottery, raise animals, and grow crops.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Homo sapiens means wise men and is the name for modern humans. Physically Homo sapiens resemble the Homo erectus, but Homo sapiens have much larger brains. </span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Nomads were the men and women of the Stone Age. They were people that traveled a lot of moved from place to place looking for food and shelter.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Hunter-gatherers were nomadic groups whose food supply mainly consisted of hunting animals and collecting food from plants. These groups actually increased their food supply by inventing tools like spears that helped them hunt.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; The Neolithic Revolution was when crops were discovered. One of the main hypothesis on how this might have happened is that when women picked berries they dropped some seeds, and when they got back to the area they saw what had grown. This was a great discovery and probably one of the biggest breakthroughs in history.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Domestication was when hunters expert knowledge of animals led to animals being trained and tamed. In the Stone age men tamed horses, dogs, goats, and pigs. This was another break though because now the animals could help them get food and made everything easier. Then nomads also took the animals with them wherever they traveled.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CIVILIZATION</span></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Civilization is a complex structure with five major characteristics, Advanced Cities, specialized workers, complex institutions, record keeping, and advanced technology.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Specialization was created when cities came about. With specialization, people were able to learn more and how to do a job, so that everyone does their own thing for the citie and benefits everyone.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; An Artisan is a person that makes things by hand, for example, a person who specialized in making tools for farming would be an Artisan. This trait allowed different cities and areas to become centers of trade.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; One example of an Institution is the Government, a long lasting pattern of organization in a community. This is a major characteristic of civilization.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; A Scribe is a record keeper, that is one trade that helped insure that we were able to find what they were saying and to learn from it, and to learn stories about their past. In this time there was no paper, so symbols were pressed into clay in the hot sun, to make engravings, which later dried up and were stored. This was the first ever recorded written history.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Cuneiform was the system of writing created by Scribes, in the common language, Cuneiform means &ldquo;wedge-shaped&rdquo;. Eventually this became so popular that many people started writing about events, wars, natural disasters, and reigns of kings.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; The Bronze Age refers to the time people started using bronze, hence the name. They first used bronze as a replacement for copper and stone. The Bronze Age started around 3000 B.C but it was different in different countries. </span></p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; The Nile Delta region is a part of lower Egypt. It begins about 100 miles before the river entered</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the river.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Narmer was a supposed king of Egypt. Kings of lower Egypt wore a red crown and the king of</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">upper Egypt wore a tall white crown. Narberth created a double crown from the red and white</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; A Pyramid was the resting place of the dead. They were basically massive tombs. But within them</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">were massive amounts of treasure.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Mummification was the process of conserving the body after someone died. This was so that they</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">could fully enjoy the afterlife and that they would stay there forever.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash;a Hieroglyphic was a flexible writing system using pictures to illustrate ideas instead of words.</span></p>
